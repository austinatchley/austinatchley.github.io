__1. What did you do this past week?__

This week, I turned in Darwin, worked on a CUDA verison of the kmeans algorithm for Concurrency, and started my final project for the same class: a GPU raytracer! Here is a screenshot of the initial implementation: ![ray-tracer](/assets/ray-tracer.png){:class="img-responsive"} If you don't know what raytracing is, I recommend this [video](https://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/innovations/hyperion) made by Disney's animation engine team for learning the basics. The shadows are still a bit rough in our implementation (Logan Zartman, our beloved OOP colleague, is my partner for this project), but it's still exciting to get something rendering. Over the weekend, I visited the Austin Bouldering Project for the first time. After only climbing on the Gregory Gym rock wall until this week, I was pleasantly surprised by how much there is to do at an actual climbing gym. It was a very cool experience, and I would reccomend beginners to experienced climbers to take the drive down to have some fun.

__2. What's in your way?__

Not much is in my way this week. I feel like I am in the last stretch of the semester, which also means that it is the calm before the storm that is finals. I have a Matrices test this week and normal homework to do, but other than that, I will enjoy the weather returning to natural spring levels!

 __3. What will you do next week?__

In the next week, I will continue work on my raytracer. Right now, our implementation only runs in a singlethreaded CPU environment, but hopefully soon, we will move to multithreaded CPU and CUDA GPU versions. Additionally, I will find a partner for the last OOP project, and I will study for my Matrices exam.

__4. What's my experience of the class?__

My experience of the class has remained positive. Darwin was the first project that I would consider challenging, and it was good to be forced to rise to the occasion. I also have enjoyed our survey of the STL both in class and in the readings. It seems to me that the C++ STL is very well designed, and I liked the bits in the textbook explaining that methods such as `accumulate()` and `for_each()` have roots in functional programming.

__5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?__

[My pick](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing) the week is an introduction to raytracing in text form, and it includes a tutorial on how to make your very own simple raytracer. Admittedly, some of the math is difficult, but I think the majority of our class would find the general idea simple and enlightening. My project will last until finals, so I will keep this blog updated with any new developments!
